Feed2MaildirSimple
============

Read RSS/Atom feeds in your favourite, maildir-compatible email client.

A simplified fork of Feed2Maildir, which doesn't use config files or databases.

Requirements
------------

-   Python 2.7+ / 3.2+
-   `feedparser`
-   `python-dateutil`

Usage
-----

Run the `feed2maildir` command. The content of the feed should be sent into the
command's standard input; if the feed is online, you might want to use `curl` or
`wget` to fetch it. The following options are available:

    -h, --help  show this help message and exit (optional)
    -m <dir>    maildir location
    -n <name>   name to use for this feed
    -s          strip HTML from the feeds (optional)

To convert a feed, the `-m` and `-n` options are required. Only a single feed
will be processed at a time; if you want to process multiple feeds, invoke the
command inside a loop.

To prevent the same items being added over and over, each generated maildir
entry is given an extra header `X-feed2maildirsimple-hash`, which stores the
given feed name and some stable identifiers from the item. Before creating a new
message, the given maildir is scanned for existing hashes, and the item is
skipped if a corresponding message already exists.

Once the process has finished, no further work will be performed. If you want to
fetch updates at regular intervals, run the command via a system like `cron`.
